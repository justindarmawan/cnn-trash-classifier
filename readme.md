# CNN Trash Classifier

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify trash images into different categories using the TrashNet dataset. The model is trained using TensorFlow, and the results are logged and tracked using Weights & Biases (W&B).

## Project Overview

- **Objective**: Build and train a CNN to classify trash images into categories.
- **Dataset**: [TrashNet](https://github.com/garythung/trashnet) dataset, containing images of various types of trash.
- **Tools Used**:
  - **TensorFlow** for model training.
  - **W&B** for experiment tracking and logging.
  - **Python** for data preprocessing and model training.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/justindarmawan/cnn_trash_classifier.git
   cd cnn_trash_classifier
   ```
